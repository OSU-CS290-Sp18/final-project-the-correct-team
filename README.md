## The Correct Team
ft. Justin Parks, Alison Jones, Arnav Bhutani, and Justin Campbell


### Brainstorming:

    Something that uses back-end data storage

    Something that any user can use

#### Hangman?

	Page that contains title
		Subpage that takes user-generated words and adds to a database, 
		uses a random one later upon initialization
		


#### Arcade game(s)?
		
    High Scores saved on the back end
    Able to implement a number of games (or backup games)

	create all but the game itself - make a div that has a graphic, but thats it
